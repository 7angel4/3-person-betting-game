# 3-person-betting-game
 Calculations of hitting probabilities for a betting game involving 3 players. At each round of the game, one player (the giver) is chosen uniformly at random to give some money to one of the other players (the receiver) chosen uniformly at random. If these two chosen players had $V and $W at the beginning of the round, then the giver must give the receiver min{$V, $W}, and the round ends.
